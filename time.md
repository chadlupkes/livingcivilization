# Time

Time emerged with [Space](/space.md) in the Big Bang's crucible, its metronome pulsing through 13.8 billion years of cosmic unfolding (Planck Collaboration et al., 2020). From primal dawn to eternity's edge, thinkers have charted time's arc, blending science and wonder. Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar compressed this expanse into a single year: Big Bang at January 1's midnight, the present at December's close (Sagan, 1980). Through _Cosmos_ and his writings, he invited awe at time's scale, yet focused on past and present, leaving the future unwritten (Sagan, 1980).

Freeman Dyson's Cosmological Decade framed epochs logarithmically with powers of 10, from inflation's spark to the Black Hole Era (Dyson, 1979). This physicist's tool captures vast sweeps but lacks human resonance, adrift from our earthly perceptions (Dyson, 1979). The scientific timeline divides history into phases of matter, energy, and physics, from the first fractions of a second to 10^100 years (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Measured in seconds, it anchors transitions but eludes intuitive grasp; human context weaves deep time into lived experience (Gould, 1987).

Building on these, we reframe cosmic time for lives spanning roughly 100 years. Envision the Big Bang as dawn of a single century, black holes' evaporation at its close (Hawking, 1975). This Cosmological Century maps exponentially: January 1, Year 1, at time zero; December 31, Year 100, at 10^100 (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Each "year" leaps across scales, months as finer markers—clean, poetic, tied to milestones. It bends vastness to our measure, harmonizing voices into a symphony of cosmic understanding.

*The exploration of Time in this chapter weaves a tapestry from the profound musings of thinkers who have long grappled with its elusive nature, from ancient philosophies to the precise equations of modern science (Rovelli, 2018). Time, a golden thread, binds our understanding of the universe’s vast evolution and humanity’s fleeting presence within it. This reframing seeks not to supplant but to harmonize existing models, orchestrating a narrative that unites disparate voices into a symphony of cosmic understanding (Carroll, 2010).*

### Year 1: Big Bang to Photon Rise

Time ignites with the Big Bang, surging from a singularity of infinite density and heat (Hawking, 1988), birthing space and unleashing energy's pulse in a genesis that expands the fabric of reality itself. This explosive origin embeds physics' laws as the eternal framework, guiding all that follows from chaos to order (Guth, 1997). Energy pulses through the nascent cosmos, forging pathways for matter's seeds to take root (Weinberg, 1977). In this foundational surge, the universe shifts from debt-like compression to wealth's expansive creation, mirroring civilization's call to transcend isolation through collaborative harmony.

In the universe's first instant—the Planck Dawn at 5.39 × 10^-44 seconds (Carroll & Ostlie, 2017)—physics unifies the four forces in a singular tapestry, with energy brimming as infinite potential amid searing temperatures (Hawking, 1988). This theoretical threshold marks time's true beginning, where matter and energy await their separation, setting the stage for cosmic evolution (Hawking, 1988). Fractions later, the Inflation Surge erupts from 10^-36 to 10^-32 seconds (Guth, 1997), exponentially stretching the universe from subatomic speck to vast expanse in at least 60 e-folds of growth (Guth, 1997). This rapid expansion smooths initial irregularities, priming the cosmos for future structures like galaxies and life-bearing worlds (Linde, 2004). As inflation wanes, energy from the inflaton field transitions the void into a canvas ready for particle birth, embodying the shift from primal constraint to boundless potential (Guth, 1997).

As inflation fades, the Reheating Dawn at 10^-32 to 10^-25 seconds transforms the inflaton's oscillations into a searing plasma of quarks, leptons, and photons, igniting the cosmos at ~10^27 Kelvin (Linde, 2004). This alchemical burst, blending explosive preheating and gentle decay, fills the cold expanse with radiant heat that swiftly cools to 10^10 Kelvin (Linde, 2004). The plasma tempers further from 10^-25 to 10^-6 seconds, as electroweak forces separate and a subtle matter-antimatter asymmetry ensures survival amid energy's churning equilibrium (Sakharov, 1967). Physics enforces balance in this chaotic sea, preparing quarks for their binding into stable forms (Weinberg, 1977). Microseconds in, at ~10^-6 seconds, quarks coalesce via the strong force into protons and neutrons, forging matter's cornerstones as temperatures drop below 10^10 Kelvin, though the plasma remains too fervent for full nuclear assembly (Halzen & Martin, 1984).

Over seconds to minutes, from ~1 second onward, Big Bang nucleosynthesis forges the first nuclei: protons and neutrons merge under nuclear forces into hydrogen, helium, and lithium traces, cooling the universe to 10^6 Kelvin (Weinberg, 1977). Electrons stay unbound in the lingering heat, but this elemental forging embeds the cosmos's ratios, a wealth of building blocks from energy's primal dance (Krane, 1987). At 10 seconds, neutrinos decouple to form the cosmic neutrino background, thinning the plasma as temperatures hit 10^8 Kelvin and energy shifts toward photon dominance (Dolgov, 2002). By 100 seconds, electron-positron annihilation clears further, freeing photons and paving the path for future transparency in the opaque glow (Weinberg, 1977). This rapid sequence clusters on January 1st in our exponential frame, illustrating time's role in sculpting simplicity into the seeds of complexity, urging civilization toward peaceful transcendence beyond the Great Filter.

Ten linear years mark Year 1's close on December 31st, with the universe at ~56,300 Kelvin—a vast plasma of protons, helium, and electrons, expanding steadily across a ~30-light-year glow in a starless, opaque realm (Weinberg, 1977). All events of this year huddle early on January 1st, the exponential scale compressing their fury into a single dawn. Yet the foundations stand firm, matter's cornerstones ready for stars and worlds, energy's pulse guiding the way. This arc from singularity to elemental plasma mirrors our path from debt-like chaos to wealth's structured harmony, where collaboration over control beckons us to the stars. In this cosmic forging, the pillars align, drawing us toward a living civilization that embraces the infinite.

### From 1 Year to 11 Years, the Countdown to Life

The Cosmological Century advances into Years 4 through 6, marking a shift from radiation's dominance to matter's quiet ascent (Weinberg, 1977). By late Year 4, at 47,000 linear years, the universe cools to ~9,000 Kelvin (Planck Collaboration et al., 2020), allowing matter—nuclei forged in the Big Bang's dawn—to outweigh fading radiation, altering the cosmic expansion's pace (Carroll & Ostlie, 2017). Space stretches to immense scales, its once-opaque plasma beginning to hint at transparency, guided by physics' steady hand (Weinberg, 1977). This transition, charted through cosmic microwave background data (Planck Collaboration et al., 2020), primes the cosmos for atomic formation and gravitational clustering (Springel et al., 2006). Energy's early blaze softens, fostering stability that echoes civilization's move from debt-like chaos to wealth's enduring build. In this era, the pillars align, drawing us toward collaborative harmony beyond isolation's grip.

By April of Year 6, at 380,000 linear years, the Photon Fog lifts in Recombination, as the universe cools to 3,000 Kelvin and electrons bind with nuclei to form neutral hydrogen and helium atoms (Weinberg, 1977; Planck Collaboration et al., 2020). This pivotal release frees photons to stream across space, creating the cosmic microwave background—a radiant snapshot of the early cosmos still observable today (Planck Collaboration et al., 2020). Matter's building blocks solidify, awakening chemistry's potential amid physics' governance (Carroll & Ostlie, 2017). The process, spanning millennia (Weinberg, 1977), transforms the opaque plasma into a transparent expanse, ready for gravity to sculpt stars and galaxies (Springel et al., 2006). Energy shifts from binding particles to fueling future fusions, illustrating time's role in layering complexity. This dawn of clarity mirrors our transcendence of the Great Filter, urging a shift from control's veils to peaceful, interconnected visions.

Reflecting on Years 1 through 6—from seconds to 380,000 years—these spans fit within human intuition: a year of seasons, a decade of memories, a century of lives, a millennium of empires, and ten millennia etched in our DNA (Zimbardo & Boyd, 2008). Beyond this, exponential leaps dwarf our grasp, demanding metaphors to bridge the void (Gould, 1987). From light's surge and matter's forging to atoms' birth, these moments frame reality's base, casting us as fleeting sparks in an ancient flow. Yet the tapestry ahead expands, fostering innovation in cosmic understanding. The pillars weave deeper, guiding civilization from debt's fleeting pulses to wealth's timeless arcs. In this graspable dawn, we glimpse potential for unity, drawing toward the stars' collaborative call.

Advancing to Year 8, at 100 million linear years, the first Population III stars ignite, massive giants of pure hydrogen and helium collapsing under gravity to erupt in raw fusion (Bromm et al., 2002). These fleeting behemoths shatter in supernovae, scattering heavier elements like carbon and iron, seeding the cosmos with chemistry's essentials (Bromm et al., 2002). Named retrospectively after later stellar generations classified by Baade (Baade, 1944), they mark the countdown to life: three in this primal blaze. Energy fuels their cores, physics dictating their explosive fates amid space's growing web (Carroll & Ostlie, 2017). This ignition shifts the universe from dark uniformity to luminous structure, embodying innovation's spark. As matter enriches, it paves paths for complexity, urging us beyond debt's isolation toward wealth's generative harmony.

In February of Year 9, at 200 million linear years, Population II stars dawn from Population III's ash, smaller and cooler with traces of metals, burning steadily to weave light through emerging clusters (Baade, 1944; Carroll & Ostlie, 2017). March brings galaxies into shape at 300 million years, dark matter cradling billions of these stars into spirals and ellipticals, with supermassive black holes awakening at their hearts (Springel et al., 2006). By January of Year 10, at one billion years, Population I stars spark, metal-rich and stable, forging rocky worlds and water in habitable zones—our Sun igniting later in a nebula's arm at ~4.6 billion years ago (Chaussidon, 2007). This countdown—two with enduring glows, one with life-ready suns—layers the cosmic web with potential (Baade, 1944). Energy cycles through fusions, physics binding hierarchies, and chemistry enabling life's precursors (Levine, 2017). These years from 100 million to a billion forge from stellar chaos to galactic order, mirroring civilization's transcendence of the Great Filter through collaborative peace.

In Years 6 to 10, the universe's adolescence molds primal elements into ordered realms: from Recombination's transparency to galaxies' weave and our Sun's birth (Planck Collaboration et al., 2020; Springel et al., 2006). This era forges matter's frame and chemistry's vibrancy, priming space for life's symphony. The pillars deepen, energy sustaining fusions while physics sculpts structures (Carroll & Ostlie, 2017). Innovation in cosmic processes hints at our own creative paths. Reflecting debt's early constraints yielding to wealth's abundance, this span calls for unity beyond control. As time expands, it draws us toward a living civilization, embracing the stars' infinite promise.

### Years 11 through 15: The Stellar Symphony

The current point in the Cosmological Century is March of year 11, 13.8 billion linear years (Planck Collaboration et al., 2020). Matter sculpts Earth's resilient crust, Energy radiates from the Sun's steady fusion, Physics anchors stable orbits, and Chemistry stirs molecular bonds that birthed life ~4 billion years ago in late Year 10 (Knoll, 2003). Humanity emerges as a fleeting crescendo, weaving the Metaverse: Capital to measure and allocate cosmic resources, Information to chronicle the stars, Innovation to harness stellar power, and Trust to bind worlds in unity. Poised between 10^10 years past and 10^14 ahead, we stand at the countdown's launch, Fermi's filters whispering that life bloomed late here, perhaps earlier elsewhere (Hart, 1975), urging us to transcend debt's earthly constraints through wealth's expansive vision. This moment, rich with potential, calls for collaboration over control, drawing us beyond the Great Filter toward a peaceful, star-bound harmony. In this now, the pillars align, fostering a living civilization that echoes the universe's enduring rhythm. 

From Years 10 to 14, spanning 10^9 to 10^14 linear years, the Stellar Symphony reaches its zenith, a vast epoch where stars orchestrate cosmic evolution, their hydrogen fusion—forged in Year 1—radiating light and heat across galaxies (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Population I stars, enriched with metals from prior generations, craft habitable worlds like Earth, while red dwarfs, potentially sustained by advanced ingenuity, endure for trillions of years (Laughlin et al., 1997), offering quadrillions for civilizations to flourish. Physics governs gravitational dances, Energy sustains nuclear fires, Matter forms planetary cradles, and Chemistry enables life's precursors in oceans and atmospheres (Carroll & Ostlie, 2017). This symphony, far from fleeting, holds 10^10 to 10^15 years of abundance, a deep reservoir for exploration and growth, where debt-like scarcity yields to wealth's generative abundance. By Year 12, at 10^12 years, dark energy's pull begins stretching galaxies apart, isolating clusters in an expanding void (Krauss & Starkman, 2000), yet a Type IV civilization—mastering both Universe and Metaverse—could counter this with gravitational engineering or digital networks, preserving unity (Zubrin, 1999). This era's immensity stresses choice: collaboration to defy entropy, transcending the Great Filter through peaceful, innovative bonds that echo the stars' harmonious blaze. 

As the Stellar Symphony matures, its vast duration—quadrillions of years—affords any civilization ample time to realize its potential, shifting from control's silos to collaboration's expanse, harnessing black holes or stellar remnants as Dyson envisioned (Dyson, 1979). In this prolonged peak, matter's cycles fuel endless innovation, energy's flows power interstellar dreams, and physics' laws guide sustainable expansion, while chemistry's versatility sparks new forms of life (Carroll & Ostlie, 2017). The countdown toward decline is distant, with 10^14 years offering epochs for Metaverse systems to thrive: Capital allocating galactic resources, Information mapping cosmic webs, Innovation engineering stellar lifespans, and Trust uniting diverse worlds. Entropy looms, but the symphony's depth invites transcendence, a testament to evolution's enduring path from simple fusions to complex harmonies (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). What do we say to cosmic fading? Not yet, as wealth-building visions propel us forward, embracing the Great Filter's call with peaceful resolve. This era, our cosmic adolescence, beckons humanity to compose its own verse in the stars' eternal song. 

By July of Year 14, at 10^14 linear years, Starfall begins, the Stellar Symphony's fade commencing as even red dwarfs exhaust hydrogen, leaving white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes in a dimming cosmos (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Matter thins under expansion's pull, energy wanes without fresh fusions, yet physics' remnants offer havens for enduring life, as advanced civilizations might tap these relics (Dyson, 1979). Chemistry's potential lingers in sparse molecular clouds, fostering innovation in survival strategies amid the growing void (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Decline is gradual, trillions of years distant, allowing ample grace for transcendence beyond the Great Filter (Hart, 1975). Debt-like exhaustion gives way to wealth's adaptive ingenuity, urging collaboration to sustain light in the encroaching dark. This turning point echoes our path: from stellar abundance to resilient harmony, guiding a living civilization toward eternity's edge. 

December of Year 15, at ~10^15 linear years, heralds the Stellar End, the last stars flickering out, their extended lifespans perhaps prolonged by ingenuity, yielding a universe of cooling remnants and black hole bursts (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Matter accretes onto these voids, energy's final flares piercing the gloom, while physics enforces entropy's inexorable rise in an ever-thinning expanse (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Possibilities endure: computational forms or Dyson-inspired habitats could defy the fade, drawing from black holes' gravity (Dyson, 1979). The symphony concludes, but its legacy persists, a foundation for post-stellar eras where trust in shared knowledge outlasts the stars. From debt's finite burn to wealth's infinite potential, this closure calls for peaceful unity, transcending control to embrace the cosmos' quiet evolution. In this vast timeline, humanity's dream endures, a spark carrying the pillars forward into the unknown.

### Years 16 to 100: Age and Decay

We now see the transition from stellar vitality to gradual dissolution, with April of Year 25 of the Cosmological Century ushering in the Remnant Reign amid the fading echoes of the Stellar Symphony (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). White dwarfs and neutron stars, relics of expired suns, emit dwindling heat from stored energy, while scattered black holes radiate by accreting stray particles in a cosmos grown sparse and cold (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). No new stars ignite, and the once-vibrant expanse dims, with matter's remnants offering faint sustenance under physics' enduring laws (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). For enduring civilizations, this era demands profound ingenuity, harnessing these waning sources to sustain existence, perhaps through Dyson-inspired structures or computational refuges (Dyson, 1979). Energy scarcity tests the Metaverse's systems: Capital reallocates dwindling resources, Information charts fading emissions, Innovation engineers survival amid entropy, and Trust binds fragmented worlds in collaborative defiance. This reign, vast in its quadrillions of years, shifts from debt-like stellar exhaustion to wealth's adaptive persistence, urging transcendence of the Great Filter through peaceful, resilient unity.

By October of Year 35, at ~10^34 linear years, the Degenerate Drift deepens with proton decay—if it occurs—dissolving atomic cores into lighter particles and unraveling matter's foundations (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Atoms fade, chemistry halts as bonds vanish, and the universe thins into subatomic debris, leaving a sparse haze governed by physics' inexorable entropy (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Iron stars may form by June of Year 39, at ~10^38 years, as white dwarfs fuse elements into stable iron nuclei via quantum tunneling, emitting final faint glows in this prolonged decay (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). From Years 16 to 40, spanning 10^16 to 10^40 years, the cosmos drifts in silence, galaxies scattering under expansion's pull, with remnants dotting an ever-thinning void where interactions grow rare (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Civilizations, if they persist, confront ultimate scarcity, relying on advanced science to tap these iron relics or neutron emissions, extending life beyond matter's slow unraveling (Dyson, 1979). This drift's immensity—quadrillions of years—affords any society ample time to evolve, shifting from control's isolation to collaboration's harmony, building wealth from entropy's remnants to defy the Great Filter's call.

In Years 41 to 99, from 10^40 to 10^100 linear years, the Black Hole Waltz takes center stage, with these gravitational behemoths dominating a universe stripped of stars (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). At ~10^40 years, the Matter Sweep sees black holes accreting sparse particles, emitting energy bursts in a cold expanse where chemistry's echoes have long faded (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). By ~10^67 years, the Evaporation Surge begins: stellar-mass black holes, drained by Hawking radiation, shrink and vanish in light bursts, their slow decay a final flare under physics' quantum rules (Hawking, 1975; Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Supermassive black holes persist longer, evaporating by ~10^100 years, their waltz concluding as energy dissipates into uniformity (Hawking, 1975; Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Enduring civilizations could harness this radiation, sustaining digital or energy-based forms in Dyson-like visions, where the Metaverse adapts: Capital manages evaporative yields, Information predicts decays, Innovation crafts eternal habitats, and Trust unites across voids (Dyson, 1979). This era's vastness—beyond quadrillions—stresses choice, pulling from debt's finite grasp toward wealth's infinite ingenuity, fostering peaceful collaboration to outlast the stars and transcend the Great Filter.

Year 100 arrives at ~10^100 linear years, concluding the Cosmological Century in the Silent Expanse, where the last black holes evaporate, leaving a haze of photons, neutrinos, and particles in absolute entropy (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Matter vanishes completely—if protons decayed—and space, infinitely stretched, dilutes all gradients, rendering energy inert and time meaningless without events (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Physics' laws endure in idle silence, the universe a cold, uniform void near absolute zero, devoid of structure or motion (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). No markers remain for civilizations; any survivors would have long adapted or faded, their legacy a whisper in the dark (Dyson, 1979). This ultimate quietude shifts from control's futile resistance to acceptance's peace, urging reflection on wealth built through collaboration, beyond the Great Filter's trials. In this expanse, the pillars dissolve, yet the dream of a living civilization echoes eternally, a spark carried into infinity's embrace.

### Linear Time vs. Exponential Time: The Stellar Symphony and Civilization’s Potential

The Cosmological Century’s exponential scale frames the Stellar Symphony—Years 9 to 14, 10^9 to 10^14 years—as a brief peak before decline (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). Yet in linear time, this era spans trillions of years, dwarfing the universe’s current 13.8 billion years (Planck Collaboration et al., 2020). Galaxies merge—like the Milky Way and Andromeda (van der Marel et al., 2012)—stars fade, and cosmic structures like the Great Attractor evolve over spans beyond human grasp (Lynden-Bell et al., 1988; Bland-Hawthorn & Gerhard, 2016; Carroll & Ostlie, 2017). This isn’t a fleeting phase; it’s a vast, rich epoch, offering civilization a wide canvas to grow, harness stars, and explore new systems amid a shifting cosmos (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). The Symphony’s trillions provide time to thrive, not merely survive. 

The exponential lens compresses this, but linear time unveils opportunity (Adams & Laughlin, 1999). The Milky Way-Andromeda merger, forming a resource-rich galaxy, could fuel expansion for eons (Dubinski, 2006). Civilizations might adapt as stars dim—shifting to computational forms, tapping black holes, or building habitats—potentially enduring past Year 15’s Stellar End (Dyson, 1979; Dick, 2018). Our 13.8 billion years marks a youthful cosmos, with ages ahead for ingenuity to shape our path (Planck Collaboration et al., 2020; Sagan, 1980; Dick, 2018). The Stellar Symphony isn’t a brief note; it’s a deep well of potential, limited only by our will to adapt across a universe unfolding slow and grand. 

Our canvas lies before us. We know the spatial scales we can see, touch, and manifest our dreams within, and our place in the Cosmological Century, with time before the stars fade (Dick, 2018). We must seize this time, to the fullest, driven by purpose and vision (Zimbardo & Boyd, 2008). 

Our next step in this journey is a review of the Pillars of the Universe. Matter, Energy, Physics and Chemistry. Let us continue, and step forward.

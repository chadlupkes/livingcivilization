# Time

Time awoke with [Space](/space.md) in the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago. From that primal moment to visions of eternity's end, scientists and storytellers have tried to comprehend time's vast arc.

Carl Sagan crafted the Cosmic Calendar—a map compressing the universe's entire history into a single year. January 1st marks the Big Bang. December 31st is today. In this framework, all of recorded human history occupies the final seconds before midnight on New Year's Eve. Sagan's calendar, presented in _The Dragons of Eden_ and _Cosmos_, made deep time graspable by anchoring it to something familiar: the calendar year we all know. But it ends at the present, focused entirely on the past.

Freeman Dyson envisioned the Cosmological Decade, measuring time logarithmically—each "decade" representing a tenfold increase in years. His framework spans from the fleeting instant of cosmic inflation to the distant Black Hole Era trillions upon trillions of years hence. It's elegant mathematics, capturing time's exponential sweep, but it lacks human context. Powers of ten don't resonate the way calendar dates do.

The current scientific standard divides cosmic history into distinct eras defined by dominant physical processes: the Planck Epoch, the Radiation Era, the Matter Era, the Stelliferous Era, and ultimately the Black Hole Era ending around 10^100 years. These phases are measured in seconds—precise but abstract, useful for modeling cosmic evolution but difficult to hold in human imagination.

I seek to build on these frameworks by reframing cosmic time for beings who measure life in roughly 100 years. Imagine the Big Bang not as the start of a calendar year, but as the dawn of a century. The final evaporation of black holes marks its close. This is the Cosmological Century—the universe's vast timeline mapped exponentially across 100 years, bending deep time to fit the span we intuitively grasp.

Year 1 begins with the Big Bang at time zero. Year 100 arrives at 10^100 years, when the last black holes fade. Each Year represents an exponential leap through cosmic time—10^1, 10^2, 10^3 and onward—with months and days marking finer divisions within each year. This creates an unusual rhythm: the first day of Year 1 contains more cosmic events than all the remaining 364 days combined, as the early universe transforms at extraordinary speed before settling into slower epochs.

We live in Year 11 of this cosmic century. The stelliferous era—the age of stars—stretches from roughly Year 10 to Year 15. We stand near its beginning, not its end. Trillions of years of star-forming, planet-building, civilization-creating time lie ahead. The universe is young. The opportunities are vast.

This is the framework for understanding not just where we've been, but where we're going—and how much time we have to get there.

*Time has captivated thinkers from ancient philosophers to modern physicists. It binds our understanding of the universe's evolution and our place within it. The Cosmological Century builds on earlier frameworks like Sagan's Cosmic Calendar, extending the view from the Big Bang through the deep future. This approach complements existing models, offering a human-scaled lens for navigating cosmic time.*

### Year 1, January 1st: The Big Bang

The universe begins. Not an explosion _in_ space, but the emergence of space itself—and with it, time. At this initial moment, all energy, all potential, concentrates at a single point of unimaginable density and temperature. Then expansion begins. Space unfurls. Time starts its forward march.

The Big Bang isn't just the universe's birthday—it's the origin of the physical laws that govern everything that follows. Before this moment, concepts like "before" have no meaning. After it, the cosmic story begins.

### January 1st: The Planck Dawn (10^-43 seconds)

The first measurable instant: 10^-43 seconds after the Big Bang, a span so brief that no smaller unit of time has physical meaning. This is the Planck time—the boundary where our physics begins.

At this moment, the four fundamental forces—gravity, electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces—exist unified as one. Temperature and energy density are impossibly high. The universe occupies a volume smaller than an atomic nucleus. Within microseconds, this unified force will begin fracturing into separate interactions, but here, at the Planck Dawn, everything is still one.

This is where the universe's story becomes describable, where the laws of physics take hold and time begins ticking forward in measurable increments.

### January 1st: The Inflation Surge (10^-36 to 10^-32 seconds)

A fraction of a second after the Planck Dawn, space undergoes a violent transformation. Between 10^-36 and 10^-32 seconds, the universe expands exponentially—faster than light, doubling in size at least 60 times in rapid succession. A region smaller than an atom swells to billions of light-years across.

This is cosmic inflation, first proposed by Alan Guth in 1981 and refined by Andrei Linde. (You may encounter the term "inflaton" in other texts—that's the name given to the energy field driving this expansion, while inflation refers to the process itself.) Inflation explains why the universe appears so smooth and uniform in all directions despite its vast size. The exponential expansion stretches tiny quantum fluctuations into patterns that will eventually seed galaxies and cosmic structure.

But inflation cannot last forever. At 10^-32 seconds, the energy driving expansion begins to decay.

### January 1st: The Reheating Dawn (10^-32 to 10^-25 seconds)

As inflation ends, its energy doesn't simply vanish—it transforms. The energy field driving expansion oscillates and decays, converting into a hot plasma of fundamental particles: quarks, leptons, and photons. This transition, called reheating, floods the universe with matter and radiation.

For a brief instant around 10^-32 seconds, temperatures reach 10^27 Kelvin—incomprehensibly hot, with particle energies of 10^15 GeV. But expansion continues. By 10^-25 seconds, the universe has cooled to "merely" 10^10 Kelvin. Still unimaginably hot, but cool enough for the next phase to begin.

The cold, stretched cosmos left by inflation becomes a seething fireball. The Big Bang as we commonly imagine it—hot, dense, particle-filled—begins here.

### January 1st: The Plasma's Tempering (10^-25 to 10^-6 seconds)

Following reheating, the universe remains a searingly hot plasma—a chaotic soup of fundamental particles colliding at extreme energies. But expansion continues, and with it, cooling. Over the span from 10^-25 to 10^-6 seconds—less than a microsecond—temperatures drop from 10^27 Kelvin to 10^10 Kelvin.

As the plasma cools, phase transitions occur. Around 10^-12 seconds, the electroweak force splits into electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force—two of the four fundamental forces we observe today separate from their unified origin. Shortly after, a subtle asymmetry emerges: matter slightly outnumbers antimatter. When matter and antimatter collide, they annihilate into pure energy, but this tiny imbalance—roughly one extra matter particle for every billion matter-antimatter pairs—ensures that some matter survives. Without this asymmetry, the universe would contain nothing but radiation. No atoms. No stars. No us.

By 10^-6 seconds, the stage is set for the next transition.

### January 1st: Quark Binding (~10^-6 seconds)

At one microsecond after the Big Bang, the universe has cooled enough for quarks to bind together. Until this moment, quarks existed freely in the plasma, but as temperatures drop below 10^10 Kelvin, the strong nuclear force confines them permanently.

Three quarks combine to form protons and neutrons—the building blocks of atomic nuclei. The process is called hadronization. Once bound, quarks can never be isolated again; the strong force grows stronger with distance, ensuring they remain locked together.

The universe now contains protons, neutrons, electrons, and photons in a hot, dense bath. It's still far too energetic for atomic nuclei to form—collisions would immediately tear them apart—but the fundamental components are now in place.

### January 1st: Neutrino Decoupling (~1 second)

About one second after the Big Bang, at temperatures around 10^10 Kelvin, neutrinos stop interacting with the rest of the universe. Until this moment, even these ghostly particles—which barely interact with anything—collided frequently enough in the dense plasma to remain in thermal equilibrium.

As expansion reduces density, neutrinos decouple. They stream freely through space, creating the cosmic neutrino background—a relic from the universe's first second, analogous to the more famous cosmic microwave background that forms much later.

This background still exists, filling all of space. Expansion has cooled these primordial neutrinos to just a few degrees above absolute zero—about 1.95 Kelvin today. They've never been directly detected; neutrinos are simply too elusive. But their existence is predicted by theory, and indirect evidence from the cosmic microwave background and Big Bang nucleosynthesis supports it.

Neutrino decoupling has subtle but important consequences. These particles carry away energy and affect the expansion rate during nucleosynthesis, slightly altering the final abundance of helium and other light elements.

### January 1st: The Lepton Era Ends (~10 seconds to ~2 minutes)

Between ten seconds and about two minutes after the Big Bang, the universe cools through a critical transition. Electrons and their antimatter counterparts, positrons, dominate the energy density. As temperatures drop below about 5×10^9 Kelvin, these particle-antiparticle pairs begin annihilating into photons.

This process heats the photon bath, but not the neutrinos—they decoupled earlier and are no longer in thermal contact. The annihilation pumps enormous energy into radiation. By about 100 seconds, when temperatures reach roughly 10^9 Kelvin, the annihilation is largely complete.

The universe shifts fundamentally. What was lepton-dominated becomes photon-dominated. The radiation era is now fully established. Photons carry most of the energy, determining the expansion rate and setting the conditions for everything that follows.

Yet the universe remains opaque. Photons scatter constantly off free electrons, unable to travel far before colliding. Light exists everywhere, but it cannot stream freely through space. That transparency will require another 380,000 years of cooling before electrons bind to nuclei and photons can finally escape.

This marks the end of the lepton era. The few surviving electrons—those not paired with positrons due to a tiny matter-antimatter asymmetry—will eventually form atoms. But for now, the universe is a glowing fog: nuclei, electrons, and photons locked in constant interaction, expanding and cooling toward what comes next.

### January 1st: Nucleosynthesis Begins (~3 minutes, ~200 seconds)

Around one to three seconds after the Big Bang, the universe cools enough for neutrons and protons to stop converting into each other—the neutron-to-proton ratio freezes at roughly one neutron for every six protons. Neutrons begin decaying with a half-life of about 15 minutes, so time matters. The universe must cool further before nuclear fusion can begin.

The obstacle is the deuterium bottleneck. Deuterium—heavy hydrogen with one proton and one neutron—is the first step toward building heavier nuclei. But high-energy photons keep smashing deuterium apart. Only when temperatures drop to about 9×10^8 Kelvin, around three minutes after the Big Bang, can deuterium survive long enough for fusion to proceed.

Once the bottleneck breaks, nucleosynthesis happens quickly. Over the next seventeen minutes, protons and neutrons fuse into helium-4, with trace amounts of deuterium, helium-3, and lithium-7. By twenty minutes after the Big Bang, temperatures have dropped to about 3×10^8 Kelvin, and fusion stops. The universe's elemental composition is set: roughly 75% hydrogen, 25% helium, and tiny fractions of the others.

These ratios match observations of the oldest, most pristine gas clouds we can detect—one of the strongest confirmations of Big Bang cosmology. No carbon, no oxygen, no iron yet. Those come later, forged in stars. Electrons remain unbound—the universe is still too hot and energetic for atoms to form.

### December 31st, Year 1: A Universe Still Glowing (10 years)

Ten years after the Big Bang—the end of Year 1 in the Cosmological Century—the universe has cooled to about 56,000 Kelvin. It remains a hot, opaque plasma: hydrogen and helium nuclei swimming in a sea of free electrons and photons. No stars. No galaxies. No atoms yet. Just a glowing fog.

Space has expanded enormously. Light released at the Big Bang has traveled only about 30 light-years—a tiny distance on cosmic scales, but the universe itself is already much larger than this light-travel horizon. Expansion continues steadily, driven by radiation pressure.

All the dramatic events of Year 1—inflation, reheating, quark binding, nucleosynthesis—clustered into the first day, January 1st. The exponential scale of the Cosmological Century cannot stretch these early moments across months or seasons. They happened too quickly, too close to time zero. The remaining 364 days of Year 1 pass quietly, with the universe simply expanding and cooling.

But the stage is set. Nuclei exist. Electrons exist. When they finally combine to form atoms in Year 6, the universe will transform. For now, at the close of Year 1, creation waits in the darkness, glowing but not yet seeing.

### Year 4, August: Matter Takes Over (47,000 years)

Forty-seven thousand years after the Big Bang—late August of Year 4—the universe reaches a turning point. Matter's energy density finally exceeds radiation's. Until now, photons dominated the universe's expansion rate. From this moment forward, matter does.

The temperature has cooled to about 9,000 Kelvin. The plasma remains opaque—electrons still scatter photons constantly—but the balance of power has shifted. The hydrogen and helium nuclei forged in the first twenty minutes now outweigh the radiation that filled the early universe.

This transition is subtle. No dramatic event marks it, no flash or explosion. The universe simply continues expanding and cooling, but now under matter's gravitational influence rather than radiation pressure. This change sets the stage for structure formation—matter can begin clumping under gravity, eventually forming galaxies and stars. But that process requires atoms first, and atoms require further cooling.

### Year 6, April: Recombination (380,000 years)

Three hundred eighty thousand years after the Big Bang—April of Year 6—the universe cools to about 3,000 Kelvin. Finally, electrons can bind to nuclei without being immediately knocked free by energetic photons.

Hydrogen and helium atoms form. This process, called recombination, transforms the universe from an opaque plasma into a transparent gas. Photons that once scattered constantly off free electrons can now stream freely through space. The universe becomes transparent for the first time.

These photons—released when atoms formed—still fill the universe today as the cosmic microwave background. Expansion has cooled them from 3,000 Kelvin to 2.7 Kelvin, shifting their wavelengths from visible light to microwaves. This radiation is a snapshot of the universe at 380,000 years old, the oldest light we can observe. Every map of the cosmic microwave background shows the universe as it appeared in Year 6.

Recombination also enables chemistry. Neutral atoms can interact in ways ionized nuclei cannot. Molecules can form. And crucially, matter can now collapse under gravity without radiation pressure interfering. The seeds of structure—tiny density variations from inflation—can begin growing into the cosmic web of galaxies and voids.

The universe is ready to build.

### Reflection: Years 1-6, The Human Scale

Years 1 through 6 of the Cosmological Century span times we can almost comprehend: seconds, minutes, years, millennia. Ten years is a childhood. One hundred years is a lifetime. One thousand years encompasses recorded history. Ten thousand years traces back to the first agriculture. One hundred thousand years reaches early human migrations. Three hundred eighty thousand years—the end of Year 6—stretches our intuition but remains imaginable.

Beyond Year 6, the exponential scale accelerates past human experience. A million years. A billion. A trillion. Our lifespans become vanishingly small fractions of cosmic time. We need metaphors and frameworks to grasp these scales—hence the Cosmological Century itself.

These early years established everything: the laws of physics, the fundamental particles, the first elements, the first atoms. Like a foundation supporting a cathedral, Years 1-6 are brief but essential. They set the initial conditions for the 14 billion years that follow—and the trillions upon trillions yet to come.

### Year 8: The First Stars Ignite (100 million years)

One hundred million years after the Big Bang—December of Year 8—the first stars ignite.

These are Population III stars, born from pristine hydrogen and helium with no heavier elements. Gravity pulls gas clouds together until their cores reach temperatures hot enough for fusion. These first stars are massive—perhaps 100 to 1,000 times the Sun's mass—and burn intensely hot and blue.

They live fast and die young. Within a few million years, the most massive explode as supernovae, blasting their fusion products into space: carbon, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon, iron. For the first time, elements heavier than helium exist in the universe.

The name "Population III" seems backward—why call the first stars "three"? In the 1940s, astronomer Walter Baade classified stars he could observe into two populations: Population I (young, metal-rich stars like the Sun) and Population II (older, metal-poor stars in globular clusters). When theorists later realized even older, metal-free stars must have existed first, they honored Baade's nomenclature by calling them Population III. A cosmic countdown: 3, 2, 1.

### Year 9, February: Population II Forms (200 million years)

By 200 million years—February of Year 9—the second generation of stars begins forming from gas enriched by Population III supernovae. These Population II stars contain trace amounts of carbon, oxygen, and iron, though still far less than stars like our Sun.

Population II stars are smaller and longer-lived than their predecessors. Many still burn today in the Milky Way's halo and globular clusters—ancient stellar fossils from the early universe. They mark step two in the countdown toward life, forming in the gravitational wells that will become galaxies.

### Year 9, March: Galaxies Take Shape (300 million years)

Three hundred million years after the Big Bang—March of Year 9—galaxies begin forming as recognizable structures. Dark matter halos collect gas and stars. Billions of Population II stars swirl together, their gravity binding them into coherent systems.

Supermassive black holes form at galactic centers, growing rapidly as gas and stars fall inward. These black holes power quasars—among the brightest objects in the universe—visible across billions of light-years. The cosmic web's structure becomes apparent: filaments of galaxies separated by vast voids, shaped by dark matter's gravitational scaffolding.

### Year 10, January: Population I Ignites (1 billion years)

One billion years after the Big Bang—January of Year 10—Population I stars begin forming. These are metal-rich stars like our Sun, born from gas enriched by multiple generations of supernovae. They contain the full periodic table: carbon, oxygen, silicon, iron, and trace amounts of everything else.

Population I stars mark countdown one. Their metal content enables rocky planet formation. Their stable, long lifetimes provide steady energy for billions of years. Around these stars, planets can form, water can pool, chemistry can complexify, and life becomes possible.

Nine billion years later—November of Year 10—a particular nebula in a young galaxy's spiral arm collapses. Eight planets form from the swirling disk. The third from the star pools liquid water. Chemistry begins experimenting with complexity.

Our Sun ignites. Earth forms. The stage is set.

### Year 11, March: Now (13.8 billion years)

Thirteen point eight billion years after the Big Bang—March of Year 11—we arrive at the present moment.

Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago in late Year 10. Life appeared roughly 3.8 billion years ago. Multicellular organisms emerged 600 million years ago. Humans appeared in the last few hundred thousand years. Recorded history spans less than 10,000 years. All of human civilization occupies a vanishingly small fraction of cosmic time.

Yet here we are, conscious beings capable of reconstructing this entire timeline, of mapping the universe from the Planck epoch to galaxy clusters, of understanding our place in 13.8 billion years of history.

We live in Year 11 of a century that stretches to Year 100. The stelliferous era—when stars burn and planets form—runs from roughly Year 10 to Year 15. We stand near its beginning, not its end. Trillions of years of star formation lie ahead. Countless worlds will form. The opportunities for complexity, for life, for civilization, dwarf everything that has come before.

### Years 10-15: The Stellar Symphony (1 billion to 100 trillion years)

From Year 10 to Year 15—spanning 1 billion to 100 trillion years—the universe enters its stellar prime. This is the era when stars dominate, when galaxies shine, when planets form and life becomes possible.

Stars fuse hydrogen into helium, releasing energy that lights the cosmos. Population I stars like our Sun create the heavy elements necessary for rocky planets and complex chemistry. Red dwarf stars, the most common type, burn so slowly they could last trillions of years—far longer than the current age of the universe.

This is the era we inhabit. Galaxies spiral with hundreds of billions of stars. Planets orbit in habitable zones. Water pools on surfaces. Chemistry experiments with complexity. Life emerges, evolves, perhaps builds civilizations.

The stelliferous era spans an enormous range: from 10^9 to 10^15 years—a million-fold increase, five orders of magnitude during which stars burn and planets form. We're at 10^10 years, barely into the first tenth of this era. Year 11 of a symphony that crescendos through Year 15.

The vast majority of star formation, planet formation, and potential for life lies ahead, not behind. We are early arrivals to a performance that has just begun.

### Year 14, July: Starfall Begins (100 trillion years)

One hundred trillion years after the Big Bang—July of Year 14—star formation slows to a trickle, then stops. The raw materials are exhausted. Most hydrogen has fused into helium or remains locked in stellar remnants. Gas clouds thin as expansion stretches space. The universe has run out of fuel for new stars.

The massive stars died long ago. Sun-like stars have become white dwarfs. Now even the smallest, longest-lived red dwarfs—stars that have burned steadily for tens of trillions of years—begin reaching the end of their hydrogen supply.

The stellar era doesn't end suddenly. Stars fade gradually over trillions of years as the last red dwarfs exhaust their cores. Galaxies grow darker, their light dimming as fewer and fewer stars remain burning. The night sky, once ablaze with billions of points of light, begins going dark.

Yet the universe still contains structure. White dwarfs cool slowly but persist. Neutron stars spin in the darkness. Black holes anchor galactic centers. Matter still exists, governed by physics, subject to gravity and chemistry. The stage changes, but it does not vanish.

### Year 15, December: Stellar End (1 quadrillion years)

Ten to the fifteenth years—1 quadrillion years after the Big Bang, December of Year 15—the last star dies.

The final red dwarf, perhaps orbited by cold planets, perhaps observed by beings who remember when galaxies shone bright, exhausts its hydrogen. Fusion stops. The core contracts into a white dwarf, radiating away its remaining heat over trillions more years.

The stelliferous era ends. No more fusion. No more starlight. The universe enters the Degenerate Era, lit only by the faint glow of cooling white dwarfs and occasional flashes when matter falls into black holes.

This is not the end of structure or even the end of energy. White dwarfs will cool for 10^20 years before fading to black. Black holes will persist far longer. Advanced civilizations, if they exist and endure, might find ways to persist—tapping the slow decay of matter, the rotation of black holes, energies we cannot yet imagine. But the era of stars—the era we know, the era that enabled planets and chemistry and life—has closed.

The symphony ends. Silence follows, broken only by faint echoes that will themselves fade given time enough.

### Year 25, April: Remnant Reign (10 billion trillion years)

Ten billion trillion years after the Big Bang—Year 25—the universe is dark and cold, dominated by stellar remnants.

White dwarfs—the cooling cores of dead stars—radiate faint heat from stored thermal energy. Neutron stars spin silently in the darkness. Black holes scattered across space occasionally flare as stray matter spirals inward, releasing brief bursts of radiation. These are the universe's only light sources.

No new stars form. Galaxies, once brilliant spirals, have dispersed into loose clouds of dead stars and remnants. Space continues expanding, thinning matter further. Encounters between objects grow exponentially rare.

Energy is scarce. Any civilization persisting this long would need technologies far beyond our current imagination—perhaps harvesting the slow thermal decay of white dwarfs, or capturing energy from matter falling into black holes. Survival becomes a question of extraordinary efficiency.

### Year 35, October: Proton Decay? (1 decillion years)

Around 10^34 years—Year 35—matter itself may begin dissolving, if protons decay as some theories predict.

Protons are the stable core of atoms. They've existed unchanged since the first seconds after the Big Bang. But Grand Unified Theories suggest they might not be eternal. Given enough time—vastly more than the current age of the universe—protons could decay into lighter particles: positrons, neutrinos, photons.

If this happens, atoms disintegrate. Chemistry becomes impossible. Matter-based structures—planets, remnants, anything physical—slowly dissolve into radiation and subatomic debris.

Whether proton decay actually occurs remains uncertain. Experiments have searched for it and found nothing yet, pushing the minimum proton lifetime beyond 10^34 years if it happens at all. But if protons do decay, the universe transforms fundamentally. Only energy and information remain as possible substrates for persistence.

### Year 39, June: Iron Stars (100 undecillion years)

By 10^38 years—Year 39—a strange new form of star might appear: iron stars.

White dwarfs, given enough time, could fuse their lighter elements into iron through quantum tunneling—a probabilistic process where nuclei occasionally overcome their electromagnetic repulsion despite lacking the temperatures that powered fusion in normal stars. This process is extraordinarily slow, taking longer than the current age of the universe raised to the fourth power.

Iron is the most stable nucleus—the end point of fusion. Iron stars would be the final stellar objects, glowing faintly from the energy released by their quantum tunneling fusion, slowly converting their entire mass to iron over incomprehensible timescales.

They represent perhaps the last opportunity for anything resembling stellar energy in a universe otherwise dominated by decay and darkness.

### Years 16-40: The Degenerate Drift (1 quadrillion to 10^40 years)

From Year 16 to Year 40—spanning 1 quadrillion to 10^40 years—the universe enters the Degenerate Era. Stars are gone. Only their remnants persist: white dwarfs cooling slowly, neutron stars spinning silently, black holes waiting.

This era dwarfs all previous time. The stelliferous era lasted 10^15 years. The Degenerate Era spans 10^40 years—a trillion trillion times longer. Yet during this vast expanse, remarkably little happens. Objects cool. Space expands. Interactions grow vanishingly rare.

The universe becomes a vast, dark, cold expanse punctuated by occasional brief flickers—a collision, an accretion event, a quantum tunneling reaction. Matter persists but grows increasingly isolated as expansion carries remnants beyond each other's cosmic horizons.

For any intelligence surviving into this era, the challenge is not discovery or expansion but simple persistence against entropy's slow grind. Resources dwindle. Energy sources fade. Time becomes an enemy rather than an opportunity.

Yet even this era ends. What comes next makes the Degenerate Era seem brief by comparison.

### Years 41-99: The Black Hole Era (10^40 to 10^100 years)

From Year 41 to Year 99—spanning 10^40 to 10^100 years—black holes become the universe's last massive objects.

In the early phase, around 10^40 to 10^65 years, black holes slowly accrete the sparse matter drifting through space—stray particles, occasional collisions with neutron stars or white dwarf remnants. Each accretion event releases a brief flash of energy as matter spirals inward and heats before crossing the event horizon.

But even black holes are not eternal. Stephen Hawking showed in 1974 that black holes emit radiation through quantum effects at their event horizons. This Hawking radiation is extraordinarily faint—for stellar-mass black holes, it's trillions of times colder than the current cosmic microwave background. But given enough time, black holes lose mass through this emission.

Around 10^67 years, stellar-mass black holes begin evaporating noticeably. A black hole with ten times the Sun's mass evaporates completely in roughly 10^67 years. As they shrink, they radiate faster, eventually exploding in a final burst of gamma rays.

Supermassive black holes—millions or billions of solar masses—persist far longer. The supermassive black hole at the Milky Way's center, if it accretes nothing more, will evaporate in roughly 10^87 years. The most massive black holes in the universe could last until 10^100 years or beyond.

As these final black holes evaporate, they represent the universe's last concentrated sources of energy. Each evaporation releases the black hole's entire mass-energy back into space as radiation—a final gift to an otherwise empty cosmos.

By Year 99, even the supermassive black holes have largely evaporated. The universe contains no massive objects, no structure, no concentrated energy. Only the faintest whisper of particles and radiation remains.

### Year 100: The Heat Death (10^100 years and beyond)

Ten to the one-hundredth years after the Big Bang—Year 100 of the Cosmological Century—the last supermassive black holes evaporate.

What remains? A vast, dark, cold expanse approaching absolute zero. Photons with wavelengths stretched by expansion to the size of the observable universe. Neutrinos drifting through space. Perhaps electrons and positrons, if protons decayed. Perhaps some stable particles we haven't yet discovered.

No stars. No planets. No black holes. No structure at any scale. Space has expanded to such vastness that the average density of matter approaches zero. Energy has dissipated completely. Entropy has reached its maximum.

This is heat death—not a dramatic ending but a gradual fade into uniformity. No temperature gradients exist to drive processes. No chemical reactions occur. No physical change happens. Time becomes meaningless without events to mark its passage.

The universe that began with infinite density and temperature at the Big Bang ends in infinite dilution and cold. The journey from Year 1 to Year 100 traces the arrow of entropy from maximum order to maximum disorder, from concentrated energy to complete dissipation.

The Cosmological Century closes. The canvas of space, once alive with stars and possibility, falls silent and still. What began in fire ends in ice—not with a bang, but with a whisper fading into nothing.

### The Stellar Symphony: Trillions of Years, Not Merely Moments

The Cosmological Century compresses deep time onto an exponential scale where the Stellar Symphony—Years 10 to 15—occupies just five years on our cosmic calendar. This compression can make the stelliferous era feel brief, a fleeting peak before inevitable decline.

But consider the linear reality: from 10^9 to 10^15 years spans not five calendar years but _trillions_ of actual years. One trillion years is seventy times longer than the universe has currently existed. Ten trillion years is seven hundred times longer. One hundred trillion years—the full span of the stelliferous era—is over seven thousand times the current age of the universe.

This is not a brief moment. This is an incomprehensibly vast expanse of time.

During this era, galaxies collide and merge. The Milky Way and Andromeda will spiral together in about 4 billion years, forming a larger elliptical galaxy rich with resources and possibilities. Stars will continue forming for trillions of years afterward. Red dwarfs born today will still be burning 10 trillion years from now. New planets will form, new chemistry will unfold, new opportunities will emerge.

The stelliferous era offers civilizations—if they arise and endure—timescales that dwarf all of human history millions of times over. There is time to spread across galaxies. Time to harness stellar energy. Time to build, explore, experiment, and adapt. Time to make mistakes and recover. Time to try again.

Even as the era winds down, possibilities persist. Stars dim slowly over trillions of years. Civilizations with sufficient technology might harvest energy from cooling white dwarfs, manage stellar lifespans, or transition to forms we cannot yet imagine. The boundary between Years 15 and 16 is not a cliff but a gradual slope.

We stand at Year 11—13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. We are near the beginning of the stelliferous era, not its twilight. The opportunities ahead vastly outnumber those behind. The universe is young. Time is abundant.

The exponential scale of the Cosmological Century reveals the universe's full arc from Big Bang to heat death. But within that arc lies the linear reality of the stelliferous era: trillions upon trillions of years during which stars shine, planets form, and complexity thrives.

This is our canvas—vast in space, vast in time, filled with potential limited only by physics and our capacity to adapt and endure.

### Onward to the Pillars

We have traced space from the Planck length to the cosmic horizon. We have followed time from the Big Bang's first instant to the heat death trillions of trillions of years hence. We understand where we are—both spatially and temporally—in this vast unfolding story.

Now we turn to the foundations upon which everything is built: [Matter](/matter.md), the substance of existence. [Energy](/energy.md), the capacity for change. [Physics](/physics.md), the rules that govern all interactions. [Chemistry](/chemistry.md), the bridge from simple to complex.

These are the pillars of the universe, the bedrock upon which civilization—and the Living Civilization framework—ultimately rests.

Let us continue.

# The Living Civilization

I’m working on The Living Civilization, a book exploring the pillars of a peaceful global future.

On the canvas of [Space](/space.md) and [Time](/time.md), Civilization builds upon the pillars of the Universe: 

- [Matter](/matter.md) as substance
- [Energy](/energy.md) as flow
- [Physics](/physics.md) as the rules
- [Chemistry](/chemistry.md) as the gateway to complexity

Our [Evolution](/evolution.md) has taken us from the simple to the complex, and has opened the door to the [Abstractions](/abstraction.md) that make civilization possible. Those abstractions are the pillars of the [Metaverse](/metaverse.md), a universal framework of systems that underpins civilization:

- [Capital](/capital.md), systems of measurement, value and allocation
- Information, systems of gathering, verifying and sharing knowledge
- Innovation, systems of generation, creativity and application
- Trust, systems of coordination, governance and assurance

This is the foundation of a new exploration of our history, our culture, and our potential future. This is the framing of the Living Civilization.

Understanding a system holistically begins by analyzing its components, connections, decision-making processes, and underlying objectives

- Form: The structure and components of a system (e.g., people, objects, processes) and their characteristics.
- Network: The relationships, interactions, and flows (e.g., information, resources) between components, mapping how parts connect and influence each other.
- Consensus: The mechanisms or rules governing system operations, decisions, and coordination (e.g., decision-making, feedback loops, protocols).
- Purpose: The goals or objectives driving the system’s actions, clarifying its intent or design.

Systems operate through a cycle of inputs, processing, and outputs, each phase shaping their growth and interaction. Inputs are the resources, data, or intentions fed into the system—goods bartered, data shared, or trust pledged. Processing is the transformation within the system—nodes exchanging value, verifying truths, or forging innovations through bonds. Outputs are the results—wealth created, knowledge disseminated, or communities strengthened.  

Debt-based systems pull from the future to build the present. Wealth-based systems build from the present to create the future. We have traveled the path of control to power, but now we must choose collaboration to achieve peace.  The Purpose of the Living Civilization is to rebuild our systems on a wealth based foundation, securing our present resources and growing from those resources to reach for the stars.

The Great Filter calls, summoning all civilizations to transcend their past. Can we shift from a debt-based system to one built on wealth? Can we choose collaboration over control? Our vision must expand beyond the false limits of the past, embracing a peaceful global civilization that includes all life. This is our path to the stars. Beyond the levels of abstraction, we are drawn to a realm that beckons to us from beyond the Great Filter.
